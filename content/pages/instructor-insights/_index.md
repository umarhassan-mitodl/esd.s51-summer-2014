## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _ESD.S51 Systems Leadership and Management Praxis_ as it was taught by Michael Davies in Summer 2014.

SL&M (Systems Leadership and Management) Praxis is a course designed to introduce students to the dynamics of strategic decision making in corporate boardrooms through team exercises, simulations, and role playing. The case studies and team exercises introduce students to strategy choices in the high tech sector, but these learnings are just as valid in other industries. Invited guest speakers from the industry who have lived through difficult corporate situations provide insights into the cases discussed in class.
